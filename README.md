# BooksAndPapers
## E-Book Repository
Here we have some books that can be used for classes.

Warning, "Here there be dragons..."

These books and papers were all found using links to free or open-source sites,
and are thus believed to *NOT* be pirated material.

Saving money for students is the over-arching goal.

## Downloaded Papers Repository
Also, this repository has several papers of interest,
which were downloaded either from websites to which there
is public accessibility or to which I have obtained previous
permissions for the materials.

Caveat Emptor, sin Carpe Diem....
