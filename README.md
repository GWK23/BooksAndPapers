# BooksAndPapers

Some books, papers, articles, and links to things that are happening as our world becomes increasingly connected.

Presented for your education, edification, entertainment, and above all to make you **THINK CRITICALLY**.....

## E-Book Repository
Here we have some books that should be used *ONLY* for my CMSI for classes.

These books and papers were all found using links to free or open-source sites,
and are thus believed to *NOT* be infringing on anyone.  If there are problems
or conflicts, *PLEASE* inform me and the offending material will be removed immediately.

Saving money for students is the over-arching goal.

## Downloaded Papers Repository
Also, this repository has several papers of interest,
which were downloaded either from websites to which there
is public accessibility or to which I have obtained previous
permissions for the materials.

Caveat Emptor, sin Carpe Diem....
